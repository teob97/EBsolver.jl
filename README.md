# EBsolver.jl

EBsolver.jl is a Julia Einstein-Boltzmann solver based on the course [AST5220 "Cosmology II"](https://github.com/HAWinther/AST5220-Cosmology/) at ITA Univeristy of Oslo (see also the [website](https://cmb.wintherscoming.no/)).

This, for now, is not intended to be a complete package capable of competing with professional codes such as CAMB or CLASS; also, not attending the University of Oslo, this is just a way for me to increase both my theoretical and practical skills in Cosmology.
